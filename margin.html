Dear Pops
</p>
<p>
To the best dad in the world. Thanks for inspiring me to explore the world and march to the beat of my own drum.
</p>
<p>It's because of you that I strive to be different.</p>
<p>You taught me by your own example to lean into and chase discomfort, to always be growing, to make a practice of trying new things.</p>
<p>You showed me how to be an independent thinker and make my own decisions.</p>
<p>I'm proud to call you my dad!</p>
<p>Love</p>
